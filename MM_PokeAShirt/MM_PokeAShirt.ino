 Bare Conductive Touch MP3 player
 ------------------------------
 
 Touch_MP3.ino - touch triggered MP3 playback

 You need twelve MP3 files named TRACK000.mp3 to TRACK011.mp3 in the root of the 
 microSD card. 
 
 When you touch electrode E0, TRACK000.mp3 will play. When you touch electrode 
 E1, TRACK001.mp3 will play, and so on.
